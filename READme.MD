# CAPSTONE PROJECT
## HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM!
___
Project Overview:
      The goal is to create a website where patients can select a disease, choose an appropriate doctor, pick an available time slot, and book an appointment.

Key Features:
   Disease Selection:
          A list of common diseases will be displayed on the website.
          Patients can select the disease they are suffering from to get more specific information and recommendations.
    Doctor Selection:
          Based on disease selected, the website will show a list of available doctors who        specialize in that disease
    Patients can view doctor profiles, including their qualifications, experience, and specialty.
  
  Select Time and Date:
    After selecting the doctor, the patient can choose a convenient date and time slot for the appointment.
    The website will show available slots for the selected doctor.
  
  Book Appointment:
    Once the patient selects the doctor, date, and time, they can confirm the booking.
    The system will send confirmation to the patient and update the doctorâ€™s schedule accordingly.
  
  Admin Panel (for doctors and admin):
    Admin will manage the list of diseases, doctors, and appointments.
    Doctors can update their availability (time slots) and view their scheduled appointments.

Steps to Implement:

Front-end:
 Disease List Page:
     Display the diseases and allow users to select the one they are suffering from.
 
 Doctor Selection Page:
     Filter doctors based on the disease selected and display their details(e.g., specialization ,qualifications).
 
 Appointment Scheduling Page:
     Allow patients to choose the date and time slot available for the doctor.
 
 Confirmation Page:
     Show the final details before confirming the appointment.
 
Back-end:
 
 Database Design:
     Disease Collection: List of diseases with associated doctors.
     Doctor Collection: Doctor details, specialties, and available time slots.
     Appointments Collection: Store booked appointments with patient details and selected doctor, date, and time.

 Endpoints:
     Get diseases and associated doctors.
     Get available time slots for the selected doctor.
     Book an appointment and update doctor availability.
 
 Admin Interface:
     Add, update, or remove diseases and doctors.
     Manage appointment bookings.

Technologies Stack Recommendations:
 
     Front-end: React or Angular for building the user interface.
     Back-end: Node.js with Express for the server-side API.
     Database: MongoDB (for handling doctor and patient data, as well as appointment information).
     Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) or session-based authentication for secure access.
